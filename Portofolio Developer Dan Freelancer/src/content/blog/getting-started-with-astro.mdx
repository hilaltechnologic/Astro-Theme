# Getting Started with Astro: A Complete Guide

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less JavaScript. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to get started with Astro and build your first project.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a web framework designed for content-focused websites. It provides:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only send JavaScript when needed
- **Component Islands** - Mix static and interactive components
- **Multiple framework support** - Use React, Vue, Svelte, and more
- **Built-in performance optimizations** - Automatic image optimization, CSS optimization, and more

## Installation

Getting started with Astro is straightforward. You can create a new project using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
# Using npm
npm create astro@latest

# Using yarn
yarn create astro

# Using pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project has the following structure:

```
my-astro-project/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
└── package.json
```

## Creating Your First Page

Let's create a simple "Hello World" page:

```astro
---
// This is the frontmatter section
const pageTitle = "Hello World";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>{pageTitle}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Astro!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using Components

Astro components are similar to other frameworks but with some key differences:

```astro
---
// src/components/Header.astro
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<header>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
    <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

## Layouts

Layouts help you create consistent page structures:

```astro
---
// src/layouts/Layout.astro
export interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

const { title, description = "Default description" } = Astro.props;
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>{title}</title>
    <meta name="description" content={description} />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Styling

Astro supports multiple styling approaches:

### CSS Modules

```astro
---
// styles.module.css
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}
---

<div class={styles.container}>
  <h1>Styled with CSS Modules</h1>
</div>
```

### Tailwind CSS

```astro
<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">
    Styled with Tailwind CSS
  </h1>
</div>
```

## Data Fetching

Astro makes it easy to fetch data at build time:

```astro
---
// Fetch data at build time
const posts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
const sortedPosts = posts.sort((a, b) => 
  new Date(b.frontmatter.date) - new Date(a.frontmatter.date)
);
---

<ul>
  {sortedPosts.map((post) => (
    <li>
      <a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## Deployment

Astro sites can be deployed to any static hosting service:

### Netlify

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to Netlify
```

### Vercel

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to Vercel
```

### GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
# Push the dist/ folder to GitHub Pages
```

## Performance Benefits

Astro's zero-JavaScript approach provides significant performance benefits:

- **Faster page loads** - No JavaScript required for static content
- **Better SEO** - Search engines can easily crawl your content
- **Improved accessibility** - Works without JavaScript
- **Lower bandwidth usage** - Smaller bundle sizes

## Conclusion

Astro is an excellent choice for content-focused websites. Its zero-JavaScript approach, component islands, and built-in optimizations make it perfect for blogs, documentation sites, and marketing pages.
